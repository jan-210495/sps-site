# Moodboard & Visual Direction

## Reference Sites
- **scout.org landing:** glassmorphic hero gradients, bold typography, textured overlays.
- **Scouts for SDGs campaign:** split-color hero with photojournalistic imagery and animated counters.
- **World Scouting news hub:** card carousel mixing photography, tags, and CTA chips.
- **Local NGO success stories (Caritas Syria, SOS Children):** warm neutrals, candid portraits, stitched textures for authenticity.

## Palette Notes
- **Deep Plum (`#4C1D76`)** for hero gradients/navbars; darker than existing burgundy for richer contrast.
- **Vivid Violet (`#7F4BA6`)** and **Magenta Edge (`#A6366E`)** for action tints and diagonal overlays.
- **Warm Sand (`#E8D7B1`)** and **Soft Ochre (`#C9A45C`)** to echo uniforms and Scout badges.
- **Service Teal (`#2E9CA1`)** + **White Helmets Blue (`#3587D2`)** for emergency/service callouts.
- Retain **Gold highlight (`#C7BB7F`)** as accent but pair with desaturated charcoal for accessibility.

## Typography
- **Headlines:** Poppins ExtraBold / Tajawal ExtraBold with expanded tracking for uppercase nav/cta text.
- **Body:** Inter / Tajawal Regular for better readability in dense stories.
- **Display scripts:** Use “Hs – Alhuda” sparingly for ceremonial quotes or Arabic hero overlays.

## Imagery & Textures
- Prioritize documentary-style photos (Good Friday processions, camps, band rehearsals) with natural lighting.
- Add subtle overlays: paper grain, woven fabric, rope fibers, and fleur-de-lis patterns at low opacity (5–8%).
- Use diagonal badges, rounded ribbons, and scout knots as repeating graphic elements separating sections.

## Layout & Motion Cues
- Hero: layered parallax (background photo, color wash, badge, CTA block) with slow zoom.
- Section separators: angled or curved edges referencing scarves; pair with gradient masks.
- Buttons/CTAs: micro-interactions (icon slide, ripple) triggered on hover/focus.
- Scroll cues: scout compass arrow + “Explore further” text rotating slightly to mimic scout signals.
